## Ideas and Project Road Map

+ Check for the latest version of questions from a GitHub repository or path, including a UNC.
+ Store long-term test results somewhere. Maybe a SQL database, maybe a JSON file.
+ Create WPF or TUO front-ends for creating and taking tests.
+ Incorporate my dynamically generated PSQuiz script as a separate command.
